Lab: Lab 11.2
Problem description: I did not know we were not supposed to use c++ libraries for MP 11 part 2. Christiaan suggested submitting a regrade request. I replaced the pow function with a for loop. Took me 4 commits since I initially changed 2^b to b^2. Then I forgot to delete the include statement. Thank you very much for the assistance. My partner (netID ashwins2) will probably also submit a regrade request soon.
